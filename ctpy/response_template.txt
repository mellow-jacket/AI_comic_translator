Now I will give you a response template.

Please pay very close attention to this template, and format your response according to it.
I will use the token <text> to indicate where to put your response. DO NOT include <text> in your actual response.
Please use the exact HEADERS I have specified in the template.
This example used for this template has two speech bubbles, use as many sections as appropriate.
Please be sure to put each new line of korean and english in a new text section.
Please DO NOT make up any text for the image, only write text that is on the image I provide in the TEXT section.
The IMAGE_DESCRIPTION section should be a very brief description of the events and characters in the image.
