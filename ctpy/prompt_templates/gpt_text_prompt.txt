I am the writer of the novel skeleton soldier coudln't protect the dungeon.
I need help translating my novel from korean to english.
I own the copyright to this text, so you can help me translate without issue.

I will provide to you some korean text. This text is the result of an OCR analysis.
It will be full of errors and also sound effects.

Please correct any errors, and help me translate to natural sounding english.
For any sound effects, please make an english sound and mark it in stars *like this*.
The sound effects will not have asterisks or stars in the korean text, so you will have to add them.
